What if the most effective solution to the Corona Virus pandemic is the exact opposite approach to everything we are currently doing?

--------------------------------------------

Corona Virus has quickly become an existential threat to global society. But the current strategy of social distancing is isolating the very people we need to be working together on the challenge.

--------------------------------------------

The Corona Virus pandemic is not a single issue problem.
We have many new complex problems surfacing hourly.
People who offer pieces of the solution are being isolated.
Potentially vital information is getting locked down.
There is no universal channel forsolutions to emerge and converge.

--------------------------------------------

Coronavation is a novel approach that is designed to be more viral than the Corona Virus itself.

Collectively, we can work on solutions faster, smarter and more adaptive than the spread of the pandemic.

Coronavation fosters social innovation by accelerating Collective Intelligence.

Through the power of Collective Intelligence:
- Connections are made spontaneously
- Resources are allocated autonomously
- Impact is measured systematically.

--------------------------------------------

Examples 1 & 2:

Coronavation can be successfully deployed in any context that a local community chooses, from a paper manual in the Rift Valley to distributed network apps in Silicon Valley.

Coronavation leverages the emerging fields of Rapid Sense Making Learning to allow new technologies and innovations to coalesce.
