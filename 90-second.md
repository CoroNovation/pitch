The Corona Virus has quickly become 
an existential threat to global society.

But the sudden practice of social distancing 
has left us with an unintended side-effect:
isolating the very people we need 
to be working together on the challenge.

While we want to slow down 
the contagion rate of the virus itself,
we actually want to accelerate
the spread of ideas and solutions.

--------------------------------------------

CoroNovation is a living system of ideas 
designed to be life-supporting and
more viral than the Corona Virus itself.

CoroNovation facilitates the ideas 
of everyday members of the community,
enabling us to access collective intelligence 
and accelerate social innovation.

The power of collective intelligence ignites:
- Connections made spontaneously
- Resources allocated autonomously
- Impact measured systematically

Collectively, we can work on solutions 
faster, smarter and more adaptively 
than the spread of the viral pandemic.

--------------------------------------------

What does this look like in the real world?

Recently, a hospital in Chiari, Italy 
ran out of respirator valves 
to treat coronavirus infections.

A local tech company heard the news 
and was able to immediately start 
3D printing the vital replacement parts.

Rapid Sensemaking allows for 
new innovations to emerge... 
anywhere, anytime, anyhow.

--------------------------------------------

There has never been a more critical time 
for humanity to embrace social innovation 
and use the power of Collective Intelligence.

Together, we can build disaster resilience 
and change the way that people 
come together to solve complex problemsâ€¦ 
forever.
